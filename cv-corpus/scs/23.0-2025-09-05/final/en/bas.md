# *Basaa* &mdash; Basaa (`bas`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Basaa (`bas`). The dataset contains 14 hours of recorded
speech (12 hours validated) from 54 speakers.

## Language
Basaa is a narrow Bantu language spoken across a geographical area spanning three administrative regions in Cameroon: the Centre, Littoral and South regions. It is estimated that there are currently around 600,000–700,000 speakers. This figure includes different varieties, as well as diasporic populations who identify as Basaa speakers.

The vitality of the Basaa language is stable (Ethnologue online). However, intergenerational transmission of Basaa is increasingly threatened among parents aged 50 and under, particularly in urban areas.

Although Basaa is taught in schools, this does not significantly impact the vitality of the language, mainly due to the current pedagogical approach, which relies on rule-based and descriptivist teaching methods.

The glossonym 'Basaa' is a generic term that encompasses a range of varieties, the speakers of which may identify with the 'Basaa' label to varying degrees, depending on a complex set of geographical, social, political, situational and pragmatic factors. Whether a language variant is considered Basaa depends greatly on the perspective of the person 'telling the story'. Some of the most commonly acknowledged varieties of Basaa include:
- Mbene
- Bikok
- Babimbi
- Basaa ba Omeng
- Basaa ba Yabasi 
Basaa ba Duala
- Ndog-Bikim

Other varieties, such as Ndonga, Mbaa (also known as Mbay-Bati) and Hijuk, may also be classified as Basaa. However, as previously mentioned, not everyone agrees on this classification.

## Text corpus
<!-- {{TEXT_CORPUS_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- An overview of the text corpus, with information such as average length (in characters and words) of validated sentences. -->

### Writing system
Basaa has several competing writing norms. The most widely used are the Catholic missionary orthography, the Prostestant missionary orthography, and a version of the General Alphabet of Cameroonian Languages that was adapted to Basaa. 

This dataset is mostly based on the Protestant missionary's orthography, with minor alterations concerning, for example, the signaling of *b* as implosive [ɓ]. For example, *m'bôñ* "cassava" vs *mbôñ* "poison". Other alterations includes the signaling of the *n-* prefix followed by the *y* symbol, to distinguish it from the complex symbol *ny*. For example, *nyo* "mouth" vs *a n'yo* "he stole palm wine from the palm trunk".
