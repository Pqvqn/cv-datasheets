# *[Eton]* &mdash; Eton (`eto`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Eton (`eto`). The dataset contains 11 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 24 speakers.

## Language
Eton is classified in the Administrative Atlas of Cameroon's Languages as a dialect of Beti-Fang, along with Mengisa, Ewondo, Bulu, Ntumu and others. [Ethnologue online](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/eto/) identifies Eton as a distinct language.
<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->

### Variants
The main contributor to this dataset identified two varieties of Eton, which he named Eton a Nke and Eton a Kwe. He declared that the collection of sentences used for read speech in this dataset represent the Eton a Nke variety. Other Eton speakers and language experts have argued that Eton is relatively homogeneous and native to nearly all indigenous populations in the Lekie Division of the Centre Region of Cameroon.
