# *Ɓàŋkón* &mdash; Bankon (`abb`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Bankon (`abb`). The dataset contains 12 hours of recorded
speech (12 hours validated) from 22 speakers.

## Language

<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- Provide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of your language -->
Bankon, also known as Abo, is a Bantu language spoken in the Moungou Division of Cameroon's Littoral Region. Bakon is closely related to Barombi, also known as Lombi, Balombi, or Barumbi, which is spoken in the Meme Division of the Southwest Region of Cameroon. Therefore, a striking trait that distinguishes the two speech groups is not their intrinsic typological distance, but the colonial demarcation between the French-speaking and English-speaking parts of Cameroon. This is a direct consequence of the joint trusteeship that France and Great Britain held over Cameroon.

### Variants 

<!-- {{VARIANT_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- Describe the variants (MCV variants) of your language -->

The language representatives who contributed to this dataset described Bankon and Barombi (also known as Lombi, Balombi, or Barumbi) as two closely related varieties. However, each is recognized as a distinct language in scientific and administrative nomenclatures. For example, the Administrative Atlas of Cameroon's Languages (Breton and Bikia Fohtung, 1991) recognizes them as such. These representatives added that there are two varieties of Bankon: South Bankon and North Bankon. According to the representatives, however, there are only minor lexical and phonetic differences between these two varieties. Speakers of each variety designate the other variety as Mwi Nwan, wich translates as "the other bank of thhe river". Additionnaly, speakers of South Bakon refer to North Bankon as *Bankon Ba Ibom*, or "Upper Bankon". Conversely, the speakers of North Bankon refer to South Bankon as Bankon Ba Nlon*, which translates as *Lower Bankon*. Other less common designations of North Bankon and South Bankon are *Banaka* and *Bayeme*, respectively.

Both the Southern and Northern dialects of Bankon are represented in the collection of sentence prompts, with a slight bias towards Southern Bankon.
