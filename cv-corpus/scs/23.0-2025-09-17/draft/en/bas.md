# *Basaa* &mdash; Basaa (`bas`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Basaa (`bas`). The dataset contains 14 hours of recorded
speech (12 hours validated) from 54 speakers.

## Language

<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
Basaa is a language spoken in Cameroon by a population of around 500k speakers. While the vitality of Basaa is considered to be stable by [ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bas/) intergenerational transmission is not systematically achieved, mostly in urban areas.

### Variants 

The number of known varieties of Basaa is not exhaustive and depends much on the perspective for representing the geography of the language. Some of the most commonly cited varieties are : *Basaa ba Ño-Nloñ*, also called *Mbene*, *Babimbi* (*Babimbi* is further sub-divided into *Babimbi 1*, *Babimbi*, *Babimbi 3*), *Basaa Ba Duala*, *Basaa Ba Yabasi*, *Lôngas*, *Donga*.

Even though Basaa is represented by the unique code `bas`, in reality, there ought to be more derivative codes that index particular dialects, as mutual understanding and mutual acceptability from one region to another is hard to measure and predict.

The sentence prompts used for read speach in the current version of the Basaa MCV dataset are mostly representative of the Mbene variety, spoken in the current Nyong-and-Kelle Division. However, a few contributors who read the sentences belong the Babimbi variety.
