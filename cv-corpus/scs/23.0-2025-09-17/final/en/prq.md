# *[Asheninka Perene]* &mdash; Asheninka Perene (`prq`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Asheninka Perene (`prq`). The dataset contains 11 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 13 speakers.

## Language
The Asheninka are a South America first nation and their language belong to the Arawak linguistic family, they are primarily located in the central Peruvian rainforest between the eastern Andes and the Ucayali River, a region known as the Gran Pajonal due to its extensive tropical grasslands. Their cultural identity is deeply tied to their language, ancestral practices, and a profound connection to their territory, which they view as essential to their livelihood and cultural distinctiveness. This relationship fosters a strong ethic of environmental respect and sustainability, central to their organized community structure and long-standing desire for formal recognition separate from other Indigenous groups.
