# *[Brahui]* &mdash; Brahui (`brh`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Brahui (`brh`). The dataset contains 11 hours of recorded
speech (11 hours validated) from 18 speakers.

## Language
Brahui is a dravidian language spoken primarily in Central and western Balochistan, Pakistan, with smaller communities in Afghanistan and Iran. Despite being geographically isolated from other Dravidian languages, Brahui has retained its distinct linguistics identity for centuries. It is spoken by around 2.8 million people and coexists with surrounding languages such as Balochi, Pashtu and Persian, which has influenced its vocabulary and structure. The language is traditionally oral, though it has been written using the Arabic scripts in modern times. Brahui holds historical significances and contributes to the rich linguistic diversity of the region. The language has three main dialects: Sarawani, Jalawani and Rakhshani, with Sarawani being the standard dialect.
