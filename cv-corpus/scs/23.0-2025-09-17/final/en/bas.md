## Text corpus

<!-- {{TEXT_CORPUS_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- An overview of the text corpus, with information such as average length (in characters and words) of validated sentences. -->

### Writing system

<!-- {{WRITING_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- A description of the writing system (or writing systems) used in the text corpus -->

Basaa has several competing writing norms. The most widely used are the Catholic missionary orthography, the Prostestant missionary orthography, and a version of the General Alphabet of Cameroonian Languages that was adapted to Basaa. 

This dataset is mostly based on the Protestant missionary's orthography, with minor alterations concerning, for example, the signaling of *b* as implosive [ɓ]. For example, *m'bôñ* "cassava" vs *mbôñ* "poison". Other alterations includes the signaling of the *n-* prefix followed by the *y* symbol, to distinguish it from the complex symbol *ny*. For example, *nyo* "mouth" vs *a n'yo* "he stole palm wine from the palm trunk".
