# *Tukí* &mdash; Tuki (`bag`)

This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Tuki (`bag`). The dataset contains 12 hours of recorded
speech (12 hours validated) from 14 speakers.

## Language

<!-- {{LANGUAGE_DESCRIPTION}} -->
Tuki is an indigenous language of Cameroon. It belongs to the Niger-Congo language family. According to [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/bag/), the vitality status of the Tuki is *stable*, and the language is *used as a first language by everyone in the ethnic community*. However, this is not confirmed by any recent study. In fact, given the general negative trend in the vitality of indigenous languages in Cameroon and other parts of Africa due to factors such as rural exodus, the shift to colonial languages such as French, and language policy, among others, it is more likely that the vitality of Tuki is threatened.
