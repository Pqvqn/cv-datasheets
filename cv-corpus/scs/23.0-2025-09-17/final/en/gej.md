# *Mina* — Gen / Mina (`gej`)

This datasheet is for the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset  
for Mina (`gej`). The dataset contains **11.43 hours of recorded speech** (collected, ongoing validation) from more than **19 recording endpoints**, mostly by women.

## Language

Mina (also called Gen, Gɛn gbe, Popo) is a Gbe language spoken primarily in southern Togo (Maritime Region) and in southern Benin (Mono Department). It is part of the Kwa branch of the Niger-Congo family. The language is used in daily communication, religious contexts, oral literature, and traditional expressions.

### Variants

This dataset focuses on the standardized Mina / Gen variety as documented in the *Alphabet des langues nationales* (Benin) and grammars of Gen. Regional lexical and phonetic variation is present (e.g. influence from neighboring Gbe languages), but the dataset aims for consistent orthography.
