Yadgha (ISO 639-3: ydg), also known as Lutkohiwar, is spoken in the Lutkoh Valley, situated approximately 46 km west of Chitral town. The Yadgha people trace their origins to the Munjan valley in Afghanistan, having migrated to the Lutkoh Valley 31 generations ago. The Yadgha community consists of around 6,000 speakers, although this number is gradually decreasing. Speakers of the language are shifting to Khowar, the lingua franca of Chitral valley.  Yadgha is a written language, and several poets compose poetry in it. However, limited literacy activities are currently underway to support the language's preservation
