# *[Ewondo]* &mdash; Ewondo (`ewo`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset 
for Ewondo (`ewo`). The dataset contains 20 hours of recorded
speech (19 hours validated) from 27 speakers.

## Language
Ewondo is a Narrow Bantu language which is indigenous to a population mainly located in the Centre Region of Cameroon, with pockets of settlements in the South, and East Regions. Having been one among the earlier developped languages within the so-called Beti-Fang group - with comparable earlier development to be found in the Bulu language of the same Beti-Fang group, Ewondo is vehicular to populations in the South and East Regions of Cameroon, and has also developed into a creole known as *Mongo Ewondo*;
