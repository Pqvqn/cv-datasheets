## Language

Wakhi or Wakhani is indigenously termed as K̃hikwor (contraction of Wuk̃hikwor). It's an old eastern Iranian or Iranic language within the Pamiri branch. Though, diasporas also live in Russia and Turkey as well as in the European, American an Australian continents, the Wakhi (or K̃hikwor) language is spoken indigenously in Pakistan, China, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Kirghizistan.   

<!-- ### Variants -->
<!-- {{VARIANT_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->

<!-- Original Answer: -->
<!-- The dataset has two key distinct varieties: Hunza Wakhi and out of Hunza Wakhi varieties. Hunza Wakhi differs not only in terms of its accent but somehow in grammatical features, too. Wakhi speakers of Ghizer and Chitral district have relatively similar accent. The grammatical aspects of these districts share a greater amount of Wakhi variety with the adjacent countries of their indigenous settlements. However, it's important to recognize that the huge vocabularies in all countries also differ to a significant level from each other, especially within technological realm in addition to following the respective national languages and some other genuine considerations. -->

There are uncountable social media forums (FaceBook, YouTube channels, or Insta) made with the name of Wakhi or in Wakhi language and cultural context. I can’t rmember all.
