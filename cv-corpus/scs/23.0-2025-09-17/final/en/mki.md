# *[Dhatki]* &mdash; Dhatki (`mki`)
This datasheet is for version 23.0 of the the Mozilla Common Voice *Scripted Speech* dataset

## Text corpus
The Dhatki corpus used in this project consists of original sentences written by the researcher. Unlike other collections that rely on religious texts or folk stories, this corpus is self-constructed (Rishi Parkash) to represent natural and everyday usage of Dhatki.
<!-- {{TEXT_CORPUS_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- An overview of the text corpus, with information such as average length (in characters and words) of validated sentences. -->

The corpus is written in the Sindhi script. While Dhatki can be written in either Perso-Arabic (Sindhi-based) or Devanagari, this dataset follows the Sindhi convention, reflecting the variety spoken in Pakistan (Sindh).
<!-- {{WRITING_SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION}} -->
<!-- @ OPTIONAL @ -->
<!-- A description of the writing system (or writing systems) used in the text corpus -->
