# Datasheets

This directory contains the Markdown files representing the datasheets. There
are two sub-directories:

* `draft/` which includes the automatically generated drafts with information from the languages page
* `final/` this contains the editted versions that have been expanded by the community.

Each directory contains subdirectories corresponding to the languages of the datasheets, e.g. `en/` for datasheets written in English. So for example, `final/en/qxp.md` is the Puno Quechua datasheet that has been finalised and is written in English.
